# Codewars Ruby Solutions
## Ruby solutions for the programming practice website Codewars

The description is more or less self-explanatory. I am doing these with the
possibility in mind that I might apply to App Academy, whose admissions
interview process and curriculum are heavily based on Ruby. I realize that
some of the problems are really trivial but I needed to cover the very basics
of Ruby as I really have barely used it before. That's why I've done some real
softball 8 kyu and beta challenges. This should not be seen as reflecting too
much on my overall ability. Eventually I intend to rank up and solve more of
the lower number (i.e. more difficult) kyu challenges.
